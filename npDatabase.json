They are:\r\n\r\n* **Chest Lock Randomization**: This option randomizes the locks on each shuffled chest (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or None), meaning that they will require different keys than in vanilla. Probabilities can be configured.\r\n* **Progressive Equipment**:  This option replaces all shuffled equipment with progressive items, balanced into various progressive item chains of approximately equal length. Massive thanks to @Treeways, without whom this would not have happened!\r\n* **Shop Randomization**: Allows items purchased from shops to be sent as locations. Multiple modes of sending and receiving are supported and can be mixed and matched.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Added support for Chest Lock Randomization, Progressive Equipment, and Shop Randomization.\r\n* Added support to Universal Tracker for chest lock randomization.\r\n* Modify the Randomizer Start button in the New Game+ options menu to indicate that the option is always on and cannot be toggled.\r\n* (@Treeways) Patched the Quest Hub Menu to show correct icons (as defined by the randomized items)\r\n\r\n## Changes to Generation\r\n\r\n* Added support for Chest Lock Randomization, Progressive Equipment, and Shop Randomization.\r\n* Renamed most chest and cutscene location names to be a bit shorter, changing full area names to single words.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Options\r\n\r\n* **Shop Randomization** (`shop_rando`): If enabled, all shops will be added to the location list.\r\n* **Shop Send Mode** (`shop_send_mode`): Controls what exactly counts as a check when shop randomization is enabled.\r\n  * **Per Item Type** (`per_item_type`): A check is added for each type of item (for example, Sandwich). Therefore, purchasing a sandwich from any shop in the game clears the same check.\r\n  * **Per Slot** (`per_slot`)  A check is added for each item slot in each shop. Therefore, purchasing a Sandwich in Rookie Harbor clears a separate check than purchasing a Sandwich in Bergen Village.\r\n* **Shop Receive Mode** (`shop_receive_mode`): Controls how shops are unlocked when shop randomization is enabled.\r\n  * **None** (`none`): All shop slots are able to be purchased as soon as the player can access the shop.\r\n  * **Per Item Type** (`per_item_type`): A check is added for each type of item (for example, Sandwich) which unlocks the ability to purchase that item from any shop.\r\n  * **Per Shop** (`per_shop`): A check is added for each shop (for example, Rookie Harbor Items) which unlocks the ability to purchase items from that shop.\r\n  * **Per Slot** (`per_slot`): A check is added for each item slot in each shop which unlocks the ability to purchase that item from\r\nthat shop (this may lead to tedious playthroughs).\r\n* **Shop Dialog Hints** (`shop_dialog_hints`): If enabled, upon opening the dialog for a shop, corresponding hints (for progressive items only) are sent to the Archipelago server.\r\n* **Progressive Equipment** (`progressive_equipment`): If enabled, equipment will be progressive, sorted into different categories according to playstyle depending on which of the other location-adding options are enabled.\r\n* **Chest Lock Randomization** (`chest_lock_rando`): If enabled, the lock on all chests (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or None) will be randomized.\r\n* **No Chest Lock Weight** (`no_chest_lock_weight`), **Bronze Chest Lock Weight** (`bronze_chest_lock_weight`), **Silver Chest Lock Weight** (`silver_chest_lock_weight`), and **Gold Chest Lock Weight** (`gold_chest_lock_weight`): Controls the likelihood of giving a chest no lock, bronze lock, silver lock, or gold lock, respectively (if chest lock randomization is enabled).\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue occurring in the base game where, in analyze mode, when playing with a controller, the cursor would not be\r\n  able to reach to all corners of the screen.\r\n* Improved the performance of the networking code (technical details follow):\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, upon connecting to a multiworld, two connections would always be opened, and one of them would\r\n    not be able to be closed by any means other than closing the game.\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, upon checking a location, the full unabridged list of received items would always be sent back\r\n    to the game, despite this information not being necessary.\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, when disconnecting from a multiworld, occasionally the client would still show as connected,\r\n    and the client would become nonfunctional as a result.\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, on every screen transition, unnecessary packets would be sent indicating the player was \"playing\".\r\n    These packets are ignored by Archipelago and are therefore unnecessary.\r\n* (@Treeways) Fixed an issue where, in the Quest Dialog menu, equipment with a level would still show as having the level even if icons were set to be obscured.\r\n\r\n# Note\r\n\r\nThis mod version is intended to be **fully compatible** with worlds generated under version 0.5.X.

Instead, when the generator requires a filler item, it randomly pulls one from the weighted filler item pools. The weights of the pools can be modified by changing relevant options (see the section in **Changes to Options**).\r\n\r\n## Changes to Options\r\n\r\n* Added Option **Start with Discs**.\r\n  * If set to a value other than \"none\", the player will start with the corresponding disc items.

It also serves as a way to demo the progressive item functionality ahead of the upcoming Progressive Equipment update. It will not be for everyone and may go away soon.\r\n* Added Options **Common Pool Weight**, **Rare Pool Weight**, **Epic Pool Weight**, **Legendary Pool Weight**, **Consumable Weight**, and **Drop Weight**.\r\n  * These options allow the player to control the likelihood of drawing from each of the filler item pools. For each level (common, rare, epic, and legendary), there exist two pools, one for consumables (like sandwiches) and one for drops (including plant drops).\r\n  * The chance of the game generating a common item is the common pool weight divided by the sum of all level weights. Then, the selection of consumable or drop is made using a similar weighted algorithm.\r\n  * Experimentation with these options is encouraged as the current default values are essentially randomly chosen.\r\n  * These options may disappear at some point if a generally accepted balance is reached.\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue where, upon receiving a progressive item after having already completed the progressive chain, the game would enter an errored state.\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Generation\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue where, when Quest Randomization was disabled, the chest **Bergen Village South - Storage Room** was not shuffled while the chest **Bergen Village - Omni Gilders Basement Left (Bronze)** was.\r\n  * This was intended to be inverted.\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Logic\r\n\r\n* **Clinging River Left** now requires Wave.\r\n* Subquests of **Training with the Master** now require Heat and Cold.\r\n* Renamed **Preemptive Mining** to **Preemptive Debugging**.\r\n\r\n# Changes since 0.5.0-pre5\r\n\r\n## Changes to Item Pools\r\n\r\n### Changes to Item Weights\r\n\r\n| Item | In Pool | Old Weight | Current Weight |\r\n|---|---|---:|---:|\r\n| Sandwich | Common Consumables | 50 | 40 |\r\n| Mega-Sandwich | Rare Consumables | 30 | 35 |\r\n| Flaming Bun | Rare Consumables | 35 | 30 |\r\n\r\n### Changes to Default Pool Weights\r\n\r\n| Pool | Old Weight | Current Weight |\r\n|---|---:|---:|\r\n| Common | 42 | 38 |\r\n| Legendary | 2 | 6 |\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Fixed a few visual glitches in the quest dialog.",
