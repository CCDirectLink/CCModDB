If `lang/sc/gui.de_DE.json` is not found in the map file, then use the previous scheme instead.\r\n\r\n- Add url_prefix entry to allow translation mods to be relocatable. Every URL found in a map_file or\r\neven the URL of the map file itself is prefixed with url_prefix. A script can get its own URL using document.currentScript.src and could derive a url_prefix value from that.\r\n\r\n- the 'en_LEA' test translation can now be enabled by putting 'en_LEA' somewhere in the query string.",

                "body": "## New Features\r\n\r\nThere are three main features whose inclusion gives this version its novelty. They are:\r\n\r\n* **Chest Lock Randomization**: This option randomizes the locks on each shuffled chest (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or None), meaning that they will require different keys than in vanilla. Probabilities can be configured.\r\n* **Progressive Equipment**: This option replaces all shuffled equipment with progressive items, balanced into various progressiveitem chains of approximately equal length.\r\n* **Shop Randomization**: Allows items purchased from shops to be sent as locations. Multiple modes of sending and receiving are supported and can be mixed and matched.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Added support for Chest Lock Randomization, Progressive Equipment, and Shop Randomization.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Generation\r\n\r\n* Added support for Chest Lock Randomization, Progressive Equipment, and Shop Randomization.\r\n* Renamed most chest and cutscene location names to be a bit shorter, changing full area names to single words.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Options\r\n\r\n* **Shop Randomization** (`shop_rando`): If enabled, all shops will be added to the location list.\r\n* **Shop Send Mode** (`shop_send_mode`): Controls what exactly counts as a check when shop randomization is enabled.\r\n  * **Per Item Type** (`per_item_type`): A check is added for each type of item (for example, Sandwich). Therefore, purchasing a sandwich from any shop in the game clears the same check.\r\n  * **Per Slot** (`per_slot`)  A check is added for each item slot in each shop. Therefore, purchasing a Sandwich in Rookie Harbor clears a separate check than purchasing a Sandwich in Bergen Village.\r\n* **Shop Receive Mode** (`shop_receive_mode`): Controls how shops are unlocked when shop randomization is enabled.\r\n  * **None** (`none`): All shop slots are able to be purchased as soon as the player can access the shop.\r\n  * **Per Item Type** (`per_item_type`): A check is added for each type of item (for example, Sandwich) which unlocks the ability to purchase that item from any shop.\r\n  * **Per Shop** (`per_shop`): A check is added for each shop (for example, Rookie Harbor Items) which unlocks the ability to purchase items from that shop.\r\n  * **Per Slot** (`per_slot`): A check is added for each item slot in each shop which unlocks the ability to purchase that item from\r\nthat shop (this may lead to tedious playthroughs).\r\n* **Shop Dialog Hints** (`shop_dialog_hints`): If enabled, upon opening the dialog for a shop, corresponding hints (for progressive items only) are sent to the Archipelago server.\r\n* **Progressive Equipment** (`progressive_equipment`): If enabled, equipment will be progressive, sorted into different categories according to playstyle depending on which of the other location-adding options are enabled.\r\n* **Chest Lock Randomization** (`chest_lock_rando`): If enabled, the lock on all chests (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or None) will be randomized.\r\n* **No Chest Lock Weight** (`no_chest_lock_weight`), **Bronze Chest Lock Weight** (`bronze_chest_lock_weight`), **Silver Chest Lock Weight** (`silver_chest_lock_weight`), and **Gold Chest Lock Weight** (`gold_chest_lock_weight`): Controls the likelihood of giving a chest no lock, bronze lock, silver lock, or gold lock, respectively (if chest lock randomization is enabled).\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nThis mod version is intended to be **fully compatible** with worlds generated under version 0.5.X. If this is found not to be the case, consider it a bug.",

Instead, when the generator requires a filler item, it randomly pulls one from the weighted filler item pools. The weights of the pools can be modified by changing relevant options (see the section in **Changes to Options**).\r\n\r\n## Changes to Options\r\n\r\n* Added Option **Start with Discs**.\r\n  * If set to a value other than \"none\", the player will start with the corresponding disc items. Disc of Insight unlocks the records menu. Disc of Flora unlocks the botany menu.\r\n  * This option was added to give players the ability to see one or both of these menus that are normally unlocked over the course of the game. In the case of the botany menu, this is especially helpful as it allows the player to work toward the botany analysis checks earlier.\r\n* Added Option **Start with Pet**.\r\n  * If enabled, the player will start with a random pet.\r\n  * This is just for fun (and for giving you emotional support as you endure the gauntlet of Archipelago).\r\n* Added Option **Progressive Area Unlocks**.\r\n  * If enabled, the items that unlock overworld areas and dungeons (including shades and some passes) will be made progressive.\r\n  * Players may choose to enable this for dungeon unlocks (i.e. Mine Pass, Yellow Sand Shade) or overworld unlocks (i.e. Blue Ice Shade, Green Seed Shade).\r\n  * If both are enabled, players may choose whether to shuffle all area unlocks into a single pool or keep them separate.\r\n  * This option was added as an alternative way to play through the game in a fashion that does not require the Get on My Level NG+ perk. It also serves as a way to demo the progressive item functionality ahead of the upcoming Progressive Equipment update. It will not be for everyone and may go away soon.\r\n* Added Options **Common Pool Weight**, **Rare Pool Weight**, **Epic Pool Weight**, **Legendary Pool Weight**, **Consumable Weight**, and **Drop Weight**.\r\n  * These options allow the player to control the likelihood of drawing from each of the filler item pools. For each level (common, rare, epic, and legendary), there exist two pools, one for consumables (like sandwiches) and one for drops (including plant drops).\r\n  * The chance of the game generating a common item is the common pool weight divided by the sum of all level weights. Then, the selection of consumable or drop is made using a similar weighted algorithm.\r\n  * Experimentation with these options is encouraged as the current default values are essentially randomly chosen.\r\n  * These options may disappear at some point if a generally accepted balance is reached.\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue where, upon receiving a progressive item after having already completed the progressive chain, the game would enter an errored state.\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Generation\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue where, when Quest Randomization was disabled, the chest **Bergen Village South - Storage Room** was not shuffled while the chest **Bergen Village - Omni Gilders Basement Left (Bronze)** was.\r\n  * This was intended to be inverted.\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Logic\r\n\r\n* **Clinging River Left** now requires Wave.\r\n* Subquests of **Training with the Master** now require Heat and Cold.\r\n* Renamed **Preemptive Mining** to **Preemptive Debugging**.\r\n\r\n# Changes since 0.5.0-pre5\r\n\r\n## Changes to Item Pools\r\n\r\n### Changes to Item Weights\r\n\r\n| Item | In Pool | Old Weight | Current Weight |\r\n|---|---|---:|---:|\r\n| Sandwich | Common Consumables | 50 | 40 |\r\n| Mega-Sandwich | Rare Consumables | 30 | 35 |\r\n| Flaming Bun | Rare Consumables | 35 | 30 |\r\n\r\n### Changes to Default Pool Weights\r\n\r\n| Pool | Old Weight | Current Weight |\r\n|---|---:|---:|\r\n| Common | 42 | 38 |\r\n| Legendary | 2 | 6 |\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Fixed a few visual glitches in the quest dialog.",

                "body": "This release contains major changes to the `settings.json` file.\r\n\r\n(Note that the legacy format is still supported)\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe options for the autosplitter are located in the `settings.json` file.\r\n\r\n## Time\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of time tracking:\r\n\r\n### IGT\r\n\r\nIf the `\"time\"` entry is not set or has the value `\"time\": \"IGT\"` the game takes the actual ingame time and sends it to livesplit.\r\n\r\n#### Example \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"time\": \"IGT\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### State\r\n\r\nThe time can be tracked using the states of the game if `\"time\": \"state\"`. If this method is used, the time is independent of the ingame time and continues even after restarts or different saves.\r\n\r\nThe possible values for the state filter (`\"filter\"`) can are:\r\n* RUNNING\r\n* TELEPORT\r\n* LOADING\r\n* NEWGAME\r\n* RESET\r\n* LOADGAME\r\n* MENU\r\n* PAUSE\r\n* LEVELUP\r\n* QUICK\r\n* ONMAPMENU\r\n* QUESTSOLVED\r\n\r\nThese values can be either used inclusive or exclusive (or both)\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"time\": \"state\",\r\n\t\"filter\": {\r\n\t\t\"include\": [\r\n\t\t\t\"RUNNING\",\r\n\t\t\t\"MENU\",\r\n\t\t\t\"LEVELUP\",\r\n\t\t\t\"QUICK\",\r\n\t\t\t\"ONMAPMENU\",\r\n\t\t\t\"QUESTSOLVED\"\r\n\t\t],\r\n\t\t\"exclude\": []\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Splits\r\n\r\nThe splits that are automatically triggered are stored as an array in `\"splits\"`. If the split contains `\"once\": true` it is only triggered once gamestart. Otherwise it is triggered on every frame the condition is valid. There are four types of splits:\r\n\r\n### Start\r\n\r\nThe `\"start\"` split is a special split that starts the timer when any map is loaded.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"splits\": [{\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"start\"\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Loadmap\r\n\r\n`\"loadmap\"` checks if the map that is loaded is the same that is in `\"name\"`.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"splits\": [{\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"loadmap\",\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"rookie-harbor.south\"\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Event triggered\r\n\r\n`\"eventtriggered\"` checks if a var condition is valid. To see which var conditions are possible enable `Print all events` in the options menu.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"splits\": [{\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"eventtriggered\",\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"maps.cargoShip/cabins1.kitchenScene\",\r\n\t\t\"value\": true\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Combined\r\n\r\nThe `\"combined\"` split is triggered if all `\"conditions\"` apply. Every condition is a split and can contain `\"once\": true`.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"splits\": [{\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"combined\",\r\n\t\t\"conditions\": [{\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"loadmap\",\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"rookie-harbor.south\",\r\n\t\t\t\"once\": true\r\n\t\t}, {\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"eventtriggered\",\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"maps.cargoShip/cabins1.kitchenScene\",\r\n\t\t\t\"value\": true\r\n\t\t}]\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```",
